In the console windows.document helps you see all the code in the website

<script></script>  script tag contains javascript code  and is normally pput at the botton th the document, because when browser is reading the code it reads from top to bottom annd when the browser is executing it will stop when it gets the script ,execute script then continue rendering the html
use an external file  <script src="script.js"></script>

putting the script tag at the bottom is also called render blocking,
where html stops rendering, js fille is downloaded, executed and then html rendering continues

async is when the script taf is at the top,when htm is rendering and then it gets a place where js is needed ,
it starts downloading the external js while still rendring html,onces download is complete
html rendering is stoped, js executed then html rendering continues

defer is where html is rendering, it meet a js code , it downoads the external js,but only once the html has completed rendering will it execute the js

type= "module" works almost the same way as components in react where we can separate and put objects in different files
when you use type modue it is automatically set to defer

objects are declared using const keyword, named using a variable name, const backpack = {} , currently 
no properties which are object value pairs 
const backpack = {
    color:"red",
}
we can have methods inside
since they are constant we can change the properties but we cant change the objects
you cant do an assignment to a constant variable

properties are separated by commas,
use camelCase to name properties

we use dot notation to access object properties

bracket notation backpack["name"]
or you can pass it in as a variable
var query = "name"
console.log(query)
use bracket notation to get more control of the properties
use bracket notation for unconventional names ,i used numbers and i needed to use bracket notation

this keyword is used to access properties of the same object


functions inside objects are called methods
toggleLid: function (lidstatus) {
    this.lidOpen= lidStatus
}

Object Class BluePrint :
class declaration using the class keyword 
we use constructor and define parameters e.g name ,then we define properties {this.name = kendo}
when using the class we use the new keyword and define just the values  {"Kendo"}
then we use type module to sort of connect this two js files

class declaration  class Name {} ,, name starts with capital
class expression const Name = class {}

to exted a class use the extend keywaord followed by the class ou want to extend

querySelector("") returns the first element based on the query
to return all matches use querySelectorAll("")
